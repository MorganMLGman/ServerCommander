# ServerCommander

Mobile application that helps manage homelab. The mobile client application is a great tool that allows to manage server quickly, conveniently and almost anytime. 

## ServerCommander compatibility

App is compatible with servers running with:
- [YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost)
- [Docker](https://github.com/docker)

under **Debian** operating system. 

## Why YunoHost?

YunoHost is a great system that helps run own server without professional IT knowledge. That;s why it is a great option for a lot of users that want to have own, private server with services, tools and applications. WebAdmin is a great option to manage server, but it is not that comfortable on mobile devices like it is on PCs. 

## Why Docker?
