# ServerCommander

Mobile application that helps manage self-hosted homelab. The mobile client application is a great tool that allows to manage your server quickly, conveniently and almost anytime. 

Within **ServerCommander** you can check such things as:
- CPU temperature
- CPU usage
- RAM usage
- Linux kernel version
- Your local and public IP
- System uptime
- Disk usage
- Most demanding app at the moment
- Number of installed packages
- And much much more (new features will be released in app updates)

If your server is running Docker in addition you can _**start/stop/restart**_ containers, briefly view containers summary and check statistics about single container.

If you are running YunoHost you can ...

However no matter what type of server you have, you can always perform actions like:
- Server shutdown
- Server reboot
- Check system updates
- Perform system update
- (New features will be released in upcoming app updates)

## ServerCommander compatibility

App is compatible with servers running:
- [YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost)
- [Docker](https://github.com/docker)

under **Debian** and **Debian-based** operating system. 

## Why YunoHost?

YunoHost is a great system that helps run own server without professional IT knowledge. That's why it is a great option for a lot of users that want to have own, private server with services, tools and applications. WebAdmin is a great option to manage server, but it is not that comfortable on mobile devices like it is on PCs. 

## Why Docker?

Docker is very powerful tool to host many applications on one machine. One of **ServerCommander** developers is using such machine :) Self-hosting with Docker is very flexible, you can choose one of thousands containers with the application you like and deploy it in a breeze.
